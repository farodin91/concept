# Branding

Grand Decentral Station is just a working title. The branding should be professional and innovative. It must not be technological by any means. It should be easy to connect with on a "human" level. Something in the line of Mailchimp, Dropbox' illustrative style or the personality of a platform like Instagram. While not copying their design it should be inspired by those. Communication should be very personal and trustful from the beginning. Marketing speech must be avoided as well as hipster-startup-jargon like "this is changing the world". Yet it should clearly show the perspective and possibilities that this system and network offers.

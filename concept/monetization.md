# Monetization

## Possible business models

This project could either be supported by crowd funding, sponsoring of initial hosting providers or with angel investor capital. The crowd funding approach fits best to the open character of the project. 

Once this has launched, collaboration with hosting providers and selling enterprise-level versions of the software could be possible business models. 

Donations or voluntary contributions from app developers with paid apps would be additional ideas to explore. 

## Possible markets

I believe that such a concept can only work if there are realistic business models that could follow such an idea or profit from it.

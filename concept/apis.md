# APIs

## Discoverability API

Connect different GDS instances, e.g. for creating a decentralized social network or offer services to the community (e.g. "Hi, I'm server xyz and I offer these services â€¦") It still needs to be solved, how the data for single users are handled in shared environments.

## Connecting instances
(just an idea)  
Let's assume Joe wants to connect his GDS instance with the one of Rick to gain access to Rick's files.  
An authentication process using a secret key could look like this:  
Joe puts the URL of Rick's GDS instace in a "Connect with an instance" dialog. Joe's GDS sents some kind of ping to Rick's GDS where a popup with a scerect connect-key shows up. Rick sends this connect-key to Joe e.g. via an ecrypted email. Joe now copies the connect-key into a dialog of his GDS instance.  
Now Joe's GDS instance hashes the connect-key and asks Rick's GDS instance if that hash equals the hash of the connect-key Rick's GDS just genrated for Joe's GDS instance.

## Administration API

Provide administration features of GDS to the outside. Possible tools connected to this would be:

- the web interface (client side code using the API)
- a command line interface installed right on the server (accessible using SSH) or on a remote workstation
- native remote applications (Windows, OS X, iOS, Android...) developed by third-party developers

This API would only work via HTTPS and would require authentication.

## Settings API

An API for applications to announce settings for the administration API.  
An application could first provide GDC with information about what settings exist, what valid values they can have and with descriptions in different languages using the settings API.

These would then be exposed to the outside using the administration API so the user can actually change the settings commonly for all applications without needing to use tons of different tools for that.

GDC remembers the current settings of each application and provides them back to the application using API endpoints of the settings API whenever the application needs them.

It has yet to be decided which field types are required to represent every possible setting (most likely quite a lot!).
